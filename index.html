            Hi, I'm Wai Yan Zaw Win, a passionate developer and lifelong learner with a background in Information Technology and a strong interest in AI, education, and sustainability. I studied IT at the University of Information Technology in Myanmar and am currently pursuing my degree in Information Systems Science and Engineering at Ritsumeikan University in Japan.

With over two years of experience as a game developer, I enjoy blending creativity with technology to build meaningful and interactive experiences. I'm currently expanding my skills in app development, data science, and UX/UI design, aiming to create solutions that are not only functional but also user-focused and socially impactful.

Outside of tech, I'm also passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge, especially English, which I've studied and mastered as a second language. I believe in continuous learning and using technology to make education more accessible and engaging.

My goal is to work on projects that align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), combining innovation with purpose. Whether it's a mobile app, a game, or an educational tool, I'm always looking for ways to create something that can make a positive difference.

Thanks for visiting and let's build something amazing together.
